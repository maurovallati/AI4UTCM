# AI for Urban Traffic Control and Mobility

This is the website for the [FLAIRS 2023](https://www.flairs-36.info/) Special Track on AI for Urban Traffic Control and Mobility.


## Call for Papers
It is expected that, during the 21st century, there will be a huge growth in urbanisation. In 2014 54% of the global population were living in urban areas, and this is projected to rise to 66% by 2050. This increase in urbanisation, coupled with the socio-economic motivation for increasing mobility, is going to push the transport infrastructure well beyond its current capacity. 

To tackle the expected growth in urbanisation, advanced traffic control mechanisms are required for situational understanding and informed decision-making to maintain a high level of service in urban traffic networks. Fortunately, a variety of data is becoming increasingly available to support innovations in control and mobility. Sensors are becoming more widespread and more reliable, and the traffic infrastructure itself is increasing the quality and quantity of data that can be acquired. Further, the advent of connected and autonomous vehicles provides an additional set of sensing modalities and the ability to communicate information to the traffic infrastructure or to neighbouring vehicles.

The aim of this special track is to foster the investigation and development of safe, robust, and trustworthy AI-based techniques for innovation in urban traffic control and urban mobility. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
*	Traffic signal control and optimisation
*	Traffic assignment and distribution
*	Public transport optimization and control
*	Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs)
*	Connected and Autonomous Vehicles
*	Fleet and logistics optimisation
*	On-demand transport 
*	Traffic data management
*	Urban traffic simulation
*	Interaction between traffic control and rail traffic management
*	Long/short term traffic prediction
*	The role of interpretability in traffic control
*	Threat modeling in urban traffic control and mobility
*	Cyber Threat Analysis in urban traffic control and mobility
*	Security by design in urban traffic control and mobility
